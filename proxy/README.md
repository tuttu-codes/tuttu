The vite dev server serving the user's Tuttu-generated app responds to both
HTTP and HMR WebSocket traffic.

We proxy this traffic for previews so that different domains can be used
to simulate different users, since different domains -> different cookies.

I couldn't get WebContainers to accept connections on different ports for
HTTP and WebSockets (although Vite is easy to configure to do this) so
we also need to proxy WebSocket traffic.

The Node.js in WebContainers does not support reading from stdin.
WebContainer.writeFile() seems incapable of writing to /tmp/foo
so it's ideal to use `node -e 'the(proxy); code()'` or
`echo 'the(proxy); code() > /tmp/proxy.cjs'`.

Writing a very short proxy that works with WebSockets should be easy
(TODO) but I couldn't get it to work. So we bundle up a simple proxy server
built with node-http-proxy aka http-proxy.
